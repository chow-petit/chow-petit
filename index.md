### THE BIG PICTURE
ONE OF THE POSSIBLE FUTURES IS ONE WHERE PATTERNS OF COMPLEXITY ARE UNDERSTOOD ON A DEEP LEVEL, AND WHERE LIVING SYSTEM DESIGN COULD ENCOMPASS BIOLOGICAL, TECHNOLOGICAL, MATHEMATICAL, SOCIETAL, EPISTEMOLOGICAL AND COGNITIVE SYSTEMS.
WE WORK TOWARDS ANSWERING SOCIETAL CHALLENGES THROUGH THIS PRINCIPLE – ON THE BASIS OF A FRAMEWORK AND PHILOSOPHY FOR AN EMERGENT LIVING SYSTEM THAT WE CALLED LIFECARING – BY CONNECTING PEOPLE, ORGANISATIONS, TECHNOLOGIES AND IDEAS IN ORDER TO GENERATE, ADAPT AND VALIDATE SOLUTIONS.
DEPENDING ON THE CHALLENGES, NEEDS AND OPPORTUNITIES, OUR OWN ROLE EMERGES AS ENTREPRENEURS, ARCHITECTS, INVENTORS, OR EXECUTORS; OR EVEN SIMPLY, ATTENTIVE OBSERVERS AND LEARNERS.
OUR DREAM IS TO FIND THE KEYS TO HELP CREATE DESIRABLE FUTURES.

L’un des futurs possibles est celui où les schémas de complexité sont compris à un niveau profond, et où la conception du système vivant pourrait englober les systèmes biologiques, technologiques, mathématiques, sociétaux, épistémologiques et cognitifs.

Nous travaillons à répondre aux défis sociétaux à travers ce principe – sur la base d’un cadre et d’une philosophie pour un système vivant émergent que nous appelons Lifecaring – en reliant des personnes, des organisations, des technologies et des idées pour générer, adapter et valider des solutions.

Selon les défis, les besoins et les opportunités, notre propre rôle émerge en tant qu’entrepreneurs, architectes, inventeurs ou exécutants; ou même simplement, des observateurs attentifs et des apprenants.

Notre rêve est de trouver les clés pour aider à créer des futurs souhaitables.

_“To be a good human being is to have a kind of openness to the world, an ability to trust uncertain things beyond your own control, that can lead you to be shattered in very extreme circumstances for which you were not to blame. That says something very important about the human condition of the ethical life: that it is based on a trust in the uncertain and on a willingness to be exposed; it’s based on being more like a plant than like a jewel, something rather fragile, but whose very particular beauty is inseparable from its fragility.”_

_“One of the things that makes us human is our internally conflicted nature, confliction, our ambivalence to our own selves. We are constantly wrestling with our own conscience and with a tendency to deviate from social norms in a risky way, and to do wrong, to be selfish. The contest within us, between doing the moral thing, even the heroic thing on one side and doing the selfish, perhaps even criminal thing on the other side, that contest is what gives us such a continuously conflicted nature. If we went and became completely altruistic then we would be like ants. If we went to the opposite extreme and had complete lack of constraint and it was complete individualism, then we would have chaos, we would not have order, the group would dissolve. So we have to be in the middle. This appears to be the human condition.“_
